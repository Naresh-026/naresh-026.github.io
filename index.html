        <h2>Project Limitations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>parking reservation system</strong> is only introduced. It is not functional yet.
                Since all the students may not be using the website to use the Parking Service at first, the reservation system may create conflict with people who do not use the service. (For example, someone reserves a parking spot using the website and another person who does not use the service uses the parking spot because he has no idea that it has been reserved already)<br></li>
            <li>Since we do not have access to the actual campus database, we have used CMS. we have used  <strong>dummy data</strong>  for parking space to be later used for what and how many parking spaces are available.</li>
            <li>Because of time limitations, we have made only the demo of the solution that we are proposing. We have used parking lots for <strong>only Hemphill Hall and the library</strong>  (The data shown on the website are not actual data).
            </li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>We will be continuing this project further improving the interactivity and functionality of the website. Some of the major improvements will include.</p>
            <li>This service is intended to be a part of ULM online services. If the project idea is accepted by the university, students will be able to login using their <strong>ULM credentials</strong> (No need to sign up).</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Reservation System.</strong> Procedures and penalty systems will be discussed with the respective campus authorities.</li>
            <li>The Data about the availability of parking will be collected using <strong>sensors</strong> (infrared and pressure).</li>
            <li>The <strong>user interface</strong> will be improved.</li>
        </ol>
